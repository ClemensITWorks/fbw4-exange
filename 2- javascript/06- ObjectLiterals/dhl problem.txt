imagine dhl uses 5kg boxes and 2kg boxes. customers have to use 1kg-units.
dhl has to decide, which amount of 5kg boxes and 2kg boxes are needed to
use the boxes with no spare room left.
minimum delivery weight is 7kg.
the combination with less handling is prefered (5kg boxes better than 2kg boxes)
create a function that takes the amount of kg and returns how many 5kg - and 2kg 
boxes are needed to transport the freight without wasting room.
